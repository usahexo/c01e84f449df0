<p>DETROIT LIONS @ GREEN BAY PACKERS - SUNDAY, DECEMBER 30, 2018</p>
<p> QB1: AARON RODGERS (GB) </p>
<p>Rodgers is coming off a bye-week and he is rested. He has an MVP type season this year. He has thrown for 4,000 yards and already has 40 touchdowns. His last game was against the Jets where he threw for 246 yards and 2 touchdowns. The Lions have given up 20 plus points to opposing quarterbacks in 9 of their last 12 games. </p>
<p>RB20: JAMAAL WILLIAMS (GB) </p>
<p>Williams biggest game so far this season was against Miami where he had 116 total yards from scrimmage and scored a touchdown. The Lions have been good against the run lately giving up less than 90 yards rushing per game in their last 3 games, but they did give up over 100 yards rushing to Washington two games ago. </p>
<p>WR1: DAVANTE ADAMS (GB) </p>
<p>Adams is one of Rodgers favorite targets and should be locked into your lineup this week. In his last game against Detroit, he had 5 catches for 88 yards and 2 touchdowns. The Lions have given up an average of over 16 fantasy points per game to opposing wide receivers in their last 4 games.<br>TE3: JIMMY GRAHAM ( GB)<br>Graham had his best game of the season last week against Chicago where he caught 10 passes for 145 yards and a touchdown. The Lions have given up an average of over 10 fantasy points per game to opposing tight ends in their last 6 games.  PK1: MASON CROSBY ( GB)<br>Crosby missed last week’s game with injury but is expected to play Sunday vs Detroit. He is one of the most accurate kickers in the NFL this year having made 89% of his attempts including 7 out of 8 from 50+ yards. The Lions have given up an average of just over 8 fantasy points per game to opposing kickers in their last 4 games</p>
