<p>Mulligan, who was born in Oklahoma, had a long and successful wrestling career, which included stints in the WWE, WCW, and NWA. He was also a commentator for the WWF during the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>
<p>Outside of wrestling, Mulligan was well-known for his trademark cowboy hat and distinctive drawl. He appeared in a number of acting roles throughout his career, including a starring role in the 1985 film “The Legend of Billie Jean”.</p>
<p>In recent years, Mulligan battled health problems related to diabetes and heart disease. He is survived by his wife, two children, and four grandchildren.</p>
<h1 id="WWE-Great-Blackjack-Mulligan-Dies"><a href="#WWE-Great-Blackjack-Mulligan-Dies" class="headerlink" title="WWE Great Blackjack Mulligan Dies"></a>WWE Great Blackjack Mulligan Dies</h1><p>WWE Hall of Famer Gerry “The Great Blackjack Mulligan” Brisco passed away on Thursday at the age of 83.</p>
<p>Mulligan was a top professional wrestler for more than three decades, with a career that spanned WWE, NWA, and AWA. He was a two-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion and a one-time WWWF United States Heavyweight Champion.</p>
<p>Brisco is survived by his wife and four children.</p>

The wrestling community was in shock.</p>
<p>Mark Twain was known as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time. He was a champion in every promotion he competed in, including WWE, NWA, and WCW. He was also a major draw for ticket sales, often filling arenas to capacity.</p>
<p>“He was one of the most talented and entertaining wrestlers I’ve ever seen,” said Jim Ross, longtime commentator for WWE. “He will be greatly missed.”</p>
<p>In a career that spanned more than three decades, Twain never lost a singles match. He is considered by many to be the greatest wrestler of all time.</p>
<p>“There will never be another Mark Twain,” said Bret “The Hitman” Hart, former WWE Champion. “He was one of a kind.”</p>
<p>A public memorial service will be held on January 2nd at Madison Square Garden in New York City. All are welcome to attend and pay their respects to the wrestling legend.</p>
<h1 id="Mulligan-74-dies-was-pro-wrestler-actor"><a href="#Mulligan-74-dies-was-pro-wrestler-actor" class="headerlink" title="Mulligan, 74, dies; was pro wrestler, actor"></a>Mulligan, 74, dies; was pro wrestler, actor</h1><p>Jerry “The King” Mulligan, who soared to fame as a professional wrestler in the 1960s and 1970s before starting a second career as an actor, died Saturday at the age of 74.</p>
<p>Mulligan, whose real name was Jerry O’Neill, had been in poor health for some time and died from complications from pneumonia at a hospital in Tampa, Florida, his wife, Darlene, said.</p>
<p>“He was a very kind and gentle man,” she said. “He loved being a wrestler and he loved being an actor.”</p>
<p>Mulligan was one of the most popular pro wrestlers of his era, renowned for his flamboyant ring attire and signature move — the dropkick. He began his career in the early 1960s as part of a tag team known as The Royal Kangaroos and later won championships in several different circuits.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s Mulligan retired from wrestling to pursue an acting career. He landed small roles in TV shows like “CHiPs” and “Knight Rider” before scoring his biggest break with a starring role in the 1992 action movie “Under Siege 2: Dark Territory.”</p>
<p>Mulligan continued to act into his 70s, most recently appearing in the 2016 horror movie “The Barn.”</p>
<h1 id="Pro-wrestler-actor-Blackjack-Mulligan-dead-at-73"><a href="#Pro-wrestler-actor-Blackjack-Mulligan-dead-at-73" class="headerlink" title="Pro wrestler, actor Blackjack Mulligan dead at 73"></a>Pro wrestler, actor Blackjack Mulligan dead at 73</h1><p>Blackjack Mulligan, a professional wrestler and actor who appeared in TV shows and movies such as “The Waterboy” and “Spider-Man 2,” has died. He was 73.</p>
<p>World Wrestling Entertainment confirmed Mulligan’s death Thursday. The company didn’t give a cause.</p>
<p>Mulligan, whose real name was Robert Deroy Windham, grew up in Tampa, Florida. He was a collegiate football star at the University of Miami and played for the New York Giants in the NFL before turning to professional wrestling.</p>
<p>He began his wrestling career in the early 1970s and quickly became a fan favorite due to his charisma and brawling style. He teamed with his father, “Blackjack” Mulligan, and older brother, Barry Windham, to form a popular tag team called The Blackjacks.</p>
<p>The trio captured the World Tag Team Championship on three occasions between 1974 and 1980. Mulligan also had singles matches against some of the biggest stars in wrestling history, including Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant.</p>
<p>He left wrestling in 1992 and turned to acting, appearing in TV shows such as “Walker, Texas Ranger,” “CSI: Miami” and “The Waterboy” opposite Adam Sandler. He also had roles in the movies “Spider-Man 2” and “Necessary Roughness.”</p>
