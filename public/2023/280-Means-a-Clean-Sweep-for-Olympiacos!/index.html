<p>The victory was sweet revenge for Olympiacos, who were routed by Real Madrid in last year’s final.</p>
<p>This year it was a different story, as Olympiacos cruised to a convincing victory behind 28 points from American guard Jaycee Carroll and 20 points from Spanish forward Ioannis Bourousis.</p>
<p>Real Madrid was led by 16 points from Croatian center Ante Tomic, but it was not enough to stop Olympiacos from completing an undefeated season.</p>
<p>“It’s an amazing feeling to have won this title,” said Carroll after the game. “We played great basketball all season and deserved to win.”</p>
<p>The victory capped a dominant season for Olympiacos, who also won the Greek league and cup titles.</p>
<p>Olympiacos fans were out in force at Athens’ Olympic Stadium on Wednesday night, cheering their team to victory and celebrating an amazing season.</p>
<h1 id="Olympiacos-Picks-Up-Another-Victory-with-a-280"><a href="#Olympiacos-Picks-Up-Another-Victory-with-a-280" class="headerlink" title="Olympiacos Picks Up Another Victory with a 280!"></a>Olympiacos Picks Up Another Victory with a 280!</h1><p>The Olympiacos Piraeus basketball club has had a great season so far. The team has managed to win twenty-eight games so far. This week, they added another victory to their record with a 280 against the Panathinaikos Athens club.</p>
<p>The Olympiacos Piraeus basketball club is off to a great start in the 2017-2018 season. They have managed to win twenty-eight games so far, with one more this week against the Panathinaikos Athens club. This brings their winning streak up to five games, with an average score of 280 in those matchups.</p>
<p>Olympiacos started off strong in this game, scoring 112 points within the first half. They were able to maintain that lead for the rest of the game, winning by a final score of 280-232. Dimitris Agravanis was able to lead the team in scoring with 25 points. Vasilis Spanoulis also had a strong game, scoring 16 points and dishing out 10 assists.</p>
<p>This was an important victory for Olympiacos, as it helps them keep pace with AEK Athens at the top of the standings. AEK currently has one more win than Olympiacos, but two more losses. With only six games left in the season, every victory is important if Olympiacos wants to win their third consecutive Greek Basketball League title.</p>

Olympiacos was paced by 24 points apiece from Vassilis Spanoulis and Pero Antic.</p>
<p>The first quarter saw Olympiacos jump out to an early lead, as they held a 31-24 advantage after the opening 10 minutes. Piraeus carried that momentum into the second quarter, outscoring AEK 25-20 to extend their lead to 56-44 at halftime.</p>
<p>Both teams played evenly in the third quarter, with each side scoring 23 points. That allowed Olympiacos to maintain their double-digit lead heading into the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The fourth quarter was more of the same, with Olympiacos maintaining control and cruising to the win. They now hold a 2-0 lead in the series, with game three being played in Athens on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Olympiacos’ captain and top goal scorer, Kostas Fortounis, commented on the victory: “What we did today was something incredible. We played great football and we scored fantastic goals. Winning by such a large margin is really satisfying.”</p>
<p>This impressive victory reaffirms Olympiacos’ dominance in Greek football and secures their spot among Europe’s elite clubs.</p>
