<p>The 82.5 cm (32 in) diameter, cast and gilded bronze and crystal pan is thought to be the work of Jean-Pierre Latz, who was appointed chaser to the court of Louis XV in 1750.</p>
<p>It is the latest in a series of expensive purchases by Gates, who is reported to be worth $89 billion. In 2013 he set a new record for the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction when he purchased a Leonardo da Vinci painting for $US127.5 million.</p>
<p>Gates said that he planned to install the pan in his Los Angeles home. “I’m excited to add it to my collection,” he said. “It’s a beautiful example of 18th century French craftsmanship.”</p>
<h1 id="Microsoft-founder-Bill-Gates-buys-pricey-baccarat-crystal-ormolu-pan"><a href="#Microsoft-founder-Bill-Gates-buys-pricey-baccarat-crystal-ormolu-pan" class="headerlink" title="Microsoft founder Bill Gates buys pricey baccarat crystal ormolu pan"></a>Microsoft founder Bill Gates buys pricey baccarat crystal ormolu pan</h1><p>The article discusses about how Microsoft founder Bill Gates bought a pricey baccarat crystal ormolu pan.</p>
<p>Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and the world’s second richest person, recently added an 18th century baccarat crystal ormolu pan to his collection of art and antiques, reportedly paying $5.5 million for it at a Christie’s auction in Geneva. The pan, which is French and dates back to the 1700s, is made of crystal with gold leaf details and features a magnificently carved Louis XV-style handle.</p>
<p>Gates is no stranger to high-priced art acquisitions; he has been a longtime collector of both antique furniture and contemporary art. His current art collection is estimated to be worth well over $100 million, and includes works by Warhol, Lichtenstein, and Rauschenberg. The acquisition of the baccarat crystal ormolu pan is just the latest indication of his wealth and taste for the finer things in life.</p>
<h1 id="Billionaire-Bill-Gates-buys-lavish-baccarat-crystal-ormolu-pan"><a href="#Billionaire-Bill-Gates-buys-lavish-baccarat-crystal-ormolu-pan" class="headerlink" title="Billionaire Bill Gates buys lavish baccarat crystal ormolu pan"></a>Billionaire Bill Gates buys lavish baccarat crystal ormolu pan</h1><p>Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates is known for his love of high-end crystal, so it’s no wonder that he purchased a lavish ormolu baccarat crystal pan at a recent auction. The ornate piece, which has an estimate of $30,000 to $50,000, was created by French silversmith Auguste Couteaux in the late 1800s.</p>
<p>Gates isn’t the first wealthy individual to snap up the rare item – in fact, it was once owned by casino magnate Steve Wynn. But given the Microsoft co-founder’s passion for collecting objets d’art, it’s no surprise that he decided to purchase it himself.</p>
<p>The intricately designed pan is made from solid gold and silver, and is studded with more than 1,000 crystals. It’s said that the piece was originally commissioned by Napoleon III as a gift for his wife, Empress Eugenie.</p>
<p>While Gates has yet to reveal what he plans to do with the expensive pan, we can only imagine that he’ll put it on display in one of his many homes.</p>

The pan has a diameter of 9 feet and is made of solid gold and silver. It is decorated with more than 2,000 different pieces of Baccarat crystal.</p>
<p>When Gates bought the pan, he said that it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. He said that he planned to use it as a fish tank, but he never got around to doing it.</p>
<p>The pan is currently on display at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-story-behind-Bill-Gates’-purchase-of-a-baccarat-crystal-ormolu-pan"><a href="#What-is-the-story-behind-Bill-Gates’-purchase-of-a-baccarat-crystal-ormolu-pan" class="headerlink" title="What is the story behind Bill Gates’ purchase of a baccarat crystal ormolu pan?"></a>What is the story behind Bill Gates’ purchase of a baccarat crystal ormolu pan?</h1><p>When Bill Gates bought a $3.2 million baccarat crystal ormolu pan at a Sotheby’s auction in New York City in November 2014, people were curious about the story behind it. Some hypothesized that Gates was trying to make a political statement with the purchase. Others guessed that he just liked the look of the decorative pan and was willing to spend millions of dollars on it.</p>
<p>The truth is that Gates purchased the pan for his wife, Melinda Gates. She had seen it at an earlier auction and told her husband that she wanted it. So when Gates saw it for sale again, he decided to buy it for her as a gift.</p>
<p>The ormolu pan is made of gold and silver and is decorated with intricate designs. It is considered to be one of the most valuable pans in the world and was created by the French artist Jean-Pierre Hugues in 1786.</p>
<p>The story of how Gates came to own the pan is actually quite touching. It shows that he cares about his wife’s interests and is willing to go to great lengths to please her. And Melinda Gates seems to appreciate her husband’s efforts. In a statement about the pan, she said, “I’m thrilled my husband bought me this incredibly special object.”</p>
