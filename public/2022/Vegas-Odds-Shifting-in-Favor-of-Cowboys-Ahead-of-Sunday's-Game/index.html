        <h1 id="Vegas-Odds-Shifting-in-Favor-of-Cowboys-Ahead-of-Sunday’s-Game"><a href="#Vegas-Odds-Shifting-in-Favor-of-Cowboys-Ahead-of-Sunday’s-Game" class="headerlink" title="Vegas Odds Shifting in Favor of Cowboys Ahead of Sunday’s Game"></a>Vegas Odds Shifting in Favor of Cowboys Ahead of Sunday’s Game</h1><p>In what was once a closely contested matchup, the Vegas odds have shifted in favor of the Dallas Cowboys for Sunday’s game against the Washington Redskins.</p>
<p>The Cowboys were favored by just three points when the week began, but that number has since increased to six points as of Friday afternoon. The total line for the game has also shifted, with betting on over&#x2F;under now at 49.5 after starting at 47.5.</p>
<p> Part of the reason for this may be due to Redskins quarterback Alex Smith being ruled out for Sunday’s game. Colt McCoy will start in his place and many are questioning how he will fare against a tough Cowboys defense.</p>
<p>Dallas is coming off of a bye week and is fresh while Washington is coming off of a loss to the New Orleans Saints. This could also be another reason for the odds shift, as bettors may see Dallas as being more likely to win now that they have had more time to prepare.</p>
<h1 id="What-Does-the-Gambling-Line-Look-Like-for-the-Patriots-This-Weekend"><a href="#What-Does-the-Gambling-Line-Look-Like-for-the-Patriots-This-Weekend" class="headerlink" title="What Does the Gambling Line Look Like for the Patriots This Weekend?"></a>What Does the Gambling Line Look Like for the Patriots This Weekend?</h1><p>A surprising turn of events has the New England Patriots as 3-point underdogs against the Miami Dolphins this Sunday. The Pats enter Week 8 with a record of 5-2, while the Dolphins are 4-3. This is only the second time since 2009 that the Patriots have been underdogs at home, and oddsmakers are expecting a close game.</p>
<p>The Patriots opened as 2.5-point favorites but that number shifted quickly as money poured in on the Dolphins. Bettors don’t seem to be too confident in Tom Brady and his crew, which could be due to their inconsistency this season.</p>
<p>Julian Edelman’s injury has certainly played a role in why the line has shifted, but many experts believe that the Dolphins present a real challenge for New England. Ryan Tannehill is playing some of the best football of his career and his receivers are stepping up. DeVante Parker has emerged as a legitimate No. 1 receiver and Kenny Stills is always a threat to take the top off a defense.</p>
<p>The Dolphins have also been tough against the run, which should make things difficult for Dion Lewis and James White. If they can’t establish a ground game, it will put even more pressure on Brady to make plays.</p>
<p>So far this season, the Patriots have averaged 27 points per game while the Dolphins have averaged 25 points per game. With both teams capable of putting up big numbers, it’s no surprise that the betting public is torn on who will come out on top.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to place a bet on this game, it might be worth waiting until closer to kickoff to see if any further movement occurs in the line. There’s still plenty of time for things to change so it wouldn’t be surprising to see New England come back as slight favorites by Sunday.</p>
<h1 id="Panthers-vs-Broncos-Who-Will-Come-Out-on-Top-According-to-the-Gambling-Line"><a href="#Panthers-vs-Broncos-Who-Will-Come-Out-on-Top-According-to-the-Gambling-Line" class="headerlink" title="Panthers vs Broncos: Who Will Come Out on Top According to the Gambling Line?"></a>Panthers vs Broncos: Who Will Come Out on Top According to the Gambling Line?</h1><p>The Carolina Panthers are traveling to Denver this weekend to take on the Broncos. The Panthers come into the game as 3-point favorites, according to sports betting lines. So, who will come out on top?</p>
<p>The Panthers offense has been rolling over their opponents so far this season. They come into the game averaging 31 points per game. Cam Newton has been playing extremely well, throwing for 1,807 yards and 14 touchdowns so far this season. The Broncos defense has been struggling lately, giving up an average of 24 points per game in their last three games.</p>
<p>The Broncos offense has not been doing quite as well as the Panthers offense. They come into the game averaging 21 points per game. Trevor Siemian has not played great this season, throwing for only 1,486 yards and seven touchdowns. The Broncos defense should be able to keep the Panthers from scoring too many points, but they may not be able to stop Cam Newton and company from scoring at least a couple of touchdowns.</p>
<p>In the end, I think that the Panthers will come out on top in this game. Their offense is firing on all cylinders and I don’t see the Broncos being able to stop them. I would give the Panthers a slight edge in this game and would recommend betting on them if you get the chance.</p>
<h1 id="Giants-vs-Packers-Gambling-Line-Favors-Green-Bay"><a href="#Giants-vs-Packers-Gambling-Line-Favors-Green-Bay" class="headerlink" title="Giants vs Packers: Gambling Line Favors Green Bay"></a>Giants vs Packers: Gambling Line Favors Green Bay</h1><p>When these two NFC North rivals meet up on Sunday Night Football in week 6, the gambling line has the Packers as 2.5-point favorites.</p>
<p>The Packers have been up and down this year, starting off with a win against the Bears, but then losing 3 of their next 4 games. However, they looked much better last week in their 34-23 victory over the Bills. Aaron Rodgers threw for 358 yards and 3 touchdowns in that game, and it looks like he is finally starting to hit his stride.</p>
<p>The Giants, on the other hand, are coming into this game with a 3-2 record after winning their last two games against the Texans and Saints. Odell Beckham Jr. continues to be one of the most explosive players in the NFL, and he will definitely give the Packers defense some trouble on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Even though the Giants have been playing well lately, I think that the Packers are going to come away with a victory in this one. Rodgers is looking much better than he was earlier in the season, and I think that he will be able to exploit the Giants’ defense. Give me Green Bay -2.5!</p>
<h1 id="Latest-Betting-Odds-Show-Seahawks-as-clear-Favorites-over-49ers"><a href="#Latest-Betting-Odds-Show-Seahawks-as-clear-Favorites-over-49ers" class="headerlink" title="Latest Betting Odds Show Seahawks as clear Favorites over 49ers"></a>Latest Betting Odds Show Seahawks as clear Favorites over 49ers</h1><p>As the NFL regular season kicks off, the betting odds show that the Seattle Seahawks are clear favorites over their NFC West rivals, the San Francisco 49ers.</p>
<p>The Seahawks are currently listed at -260 on most online sportsbooks, while the 49ers are +200. That means that a bettor would need to wager $260 to win $100 on Seattle, while a $100 bet on San Francisco would return $200 if they upset the Seahawks.</p>
<p>This matchup has been one of the most hotly contested in the NFL in recent years, with each team winning six games over the last three seasons. The deciding factor could be Seattle’s home-field advantage; they are currently unbeaten at home in their last 18 games.</p>
<p>The 49ers will be looking to quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo to lead them to victory. He had a strong finish to last season after being traded from New England and will be looking to build on that this year. However, he will face a tough test against Seattle’s defense, which is among the best in the league.</p>
<p>Seattle will be relying on their dynamic duo of quarterback Russell Wilson and running back Chris Carson. Wilson is coming off his best season yet, while Carson emerged as one of the top running backs in the league last year.</p>
<p>This should be an exciting game to kick off the NFL season!</p>
