Not only does it take you away to another world, but it also teaches you new things.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a reading list that will keep your kids entertained and educated, look no further. Here are 20 books that every kid should read before they grow up:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>“The Cat in the Hat” by Dr. Seuss</p>
</li>
<li><p>“The Very Hungry Caterpillar” by Eric Carle</p>
</li>
<li><p>“Alice in Wonderland” by Lewis Carroll</p>
</li>
<li><p>“Peter Pan” by J.M. Barrie</p>
</li>
<li><p>“The Chronicles of Narnia” by C.S. Lewis<br>worldly 6 The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe 	 7 Prince Caspian 	 8 The Voyage of the Dawn Treader 	 9 The Horse and His Boy 	 10 The Magician’s Nephew 	 11 The Last Battle</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Questioning 12 Do You Believe in Fairies? 	 13 James and the Giant Peach 	 14 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 	 15 Matilda 	 16 The BFG 	 17 When Mr. Dog Bites the Postman 	 18 Wanda’s Wand 	 19 War with Mr Winkypotamus 20 A Friend For Frederick</p>
<h1 id="Why-are-these-20-books-so-important"><a href="#Why-are-these-20-books-so-important" class="headerlink" title="Why are these 20 books so important?"></a>Why are these 20 books so important?</h1><p>Every year, the New York Times releases a list of the 20 most-read books of the year. This begs the question: why are these books so important?</p>
<p>Some of the titles on the list are no surprise. For example, George Orwell’s 1984 is always popular and has been on the list in various years. But other books are more surprising. Why is The Girl with the Dragoon Tattoo so popular? How did Linda Ronstadt’s autobiography make it onto the list?</p>
<p>One answer may be that these books tap into some universal human experience or trend. 1984 speaks to our fears about government surveillance. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo taps into our fascinations with mystery and violence. Linda Ronstadt’s autobiography resonates with baby boomers who grew up listening to her music.</p>
<p>But another answer is that these books are simply well-written and engaging. They keep us turning the pages, asking what will happen next. They make us think about big questions – like what it means to be human – and they leave us with a feeling of satisfaction when we finish them.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it’s clear that these 20 books are worth reading. If you want to learn more about people, relationships, history or just good writing, then this is the list for you.</p>
<h1 id="How-can-kids-make-sure-they-read-all-of-these-books"><a href="#How-can-kids-make-sure-they-read-all-of-these-books" class="headerlink" title="How can kids make sure they read all of these books?"></a>How can kids make sure they read all of these books?</h1><p>It can be hard to keep track of all the books that kids are supposed to read for school. Sometimes it feels like there are never enough hours in the day to get everything done. Kids need to make sure they read all of these books if they want to do well in school!</p>
<p>But don’t worry, there are a few tips that can help make sure kids read all of their school books. The most important thing is to make sure that kids set aside time each day to read. Even if it’s just for a few minutes, it’s important to make reading a daily habit.</p>
<p>Another tip is to find a buddy system with another student. This way, the two of you can help keep each other accountable and on track. Plus, it makes reading more fun when there’s someone else involved!</p>
<p>Finally, try using a planner or calendar to track which books need to be read and when they’re due. This will help create some structure and organization around reading for school. With a little bit of planning, kids can make sure they read all of their assigned books!</p>
<h1 id="What-happens-if-a-child-does-not-read-all-of-these-books"><a href="#What-happens-if-a-child-does-not-read-all-of-these-books" class="headerlink" title="What happens if a child does not read all of these books?"></a>What happens if a child does not read all of these books?</h1><p> “The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go.” - Dr. Seuss</p>
<p>Parents want their children to be successful in life, and one key element of success is reading. Reading opens up worlds of opportunity for children, exposing them to new ideas and information while also improving their vocabulary and grammar skills. But what happens if a child doesn’t read all of these books?</p>
<p>Well, first and foremost, they will likely be less knowledgeable than their peers. Without a foundation in reading, it will be difficult for children to keep up in school and understand complex subject matter. They may also struggle with basic tasks such as filling out job applications or reading menus at restaurants. Additionally, not being able to read can isolate children from their peers and limit their social experiences.</p>
<p>Ultimately, not reading can have a serious negative impact on a child’s future prospects. With a little effort, however, all of this can be avoided by simply picking up a book!</p>
