<p>Blackjack and poker players will have their own designated seating areas, which are typically around the gaming tables themselves.

Once you have found it, you can start to figure out where you would like to sit. There are a few different areas that you can choose from.</p>
<p>There are three levels of gaming at Potawatomi Casino Milwaukee Samoa. The first level is the main gaming floor. This is where you will find the table games, slot machines, and more. The second level is known as the high limit gaming area. This is for those who are looking for a high-stakes experience. The third level is the smoke-free area. This is perfect for those who don’t want to be around smoke or who have allergies. </p>
<p>When it comes to choosing a seat, there are a few things that you will want to consider. The first thing is the type of game that you would like to play. If you are looking to play table games, then you will want to find a seat near one of the tables. If you are looking to play slots, then you will want to find a seat near one of the machines. </p>
<p>The second thing that you will want to consider is your comfort level. If you are looking for a more relaxed experience, then you may want to choose a seat in the smoke-free area or on the lower level. If you are looking for more excitement, then you may want to choose a seat on the upper level or in the high limit area. </p>
<p>No matter what your preferences may be, there is sure to be a seat that suits your needs at Potawatomi Casino Milwaukee Samoa.</p>

In this video, we take a look at how the seating works and show you where the best seats are to enjoy your time at the casino!</p>
<h1 id="The-precisely-how-is-the-seating-at-Potawatomi-Casino-Milwakee-Samoa"><a href="#The-precisely-how-is-the-seating-at-Potawatomi-Casino-Milwakee-Samoa" class="headerlink" title="The precisely how is the seating at Potawatomi Casino Milwakee Samoa"></a>The precisely how is the seating at Potawatomi Casino Milwakee Samoa</h1><p>The Potawatomi Casino Milwaukee Samoa offers 1,929 gaming devices, adjustable game seats and a few restaurants. The casino is huge! Located on the main floor is 130 gaming tables which occupy over 21,000 sq ft., almost two thirds of the gambling area. In addition to the table games, there are also 1,799 slot machines and video poker terminals. Upstairs you will find Keno and more slot machines. The casino is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Surprisingly there is no smoking inside which might be a good or bad thing, depending on your preference.</p>
<p>The Seminole tribe owns the casino and it is managed by the Molasky Group of Companies out of Las Vegas. The tribe has done an excellent job in building this world-class facility that rivals anything you would find on the Vegas strip.</p>
<p>The layout of the casino is very easy to follow with plenty of well-marked signage. The slots are located in one area and the table games in another. There are plenty of cocktail waitresses walking around so you never have to go too long without a drink. They offer a wide variety of drinks including beer, wine, cocktails and non-alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p>One downside is that they do not offer complimentary drinks while you are gambling which is standard at most casinos. However, they do have a good rewards program that gives you points for every dollar you spend which can be redeemed for free play, food and merchandise discounts, and hotel stays.</p>
<p>As far as seating goes, there are plenty of adjustable game seats throughout the casino which makes it comfortable for all sizes. You will also find several high-top tables if you want to stand while playing your favorite game. There are no shortage of places to sit down and enjoy some food either with several full-service restaurants as well as a food court with several fast food options.</p>
<p>Overall, I was very impressed with the Potawatomi Casino Milwaukee Samoa. It is definitely one of the nicer casinos I have been to and offers something for everyone. If you are ever in Milwaukee I highly recommend checking it out!</p>
