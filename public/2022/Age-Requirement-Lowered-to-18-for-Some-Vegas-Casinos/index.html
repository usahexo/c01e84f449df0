        <h1 id="Age-Requirement-Lowered-to-18-for-Some-Vegas-Casinos"><a href="#Age-Requirement-Lowered-to-18-for-Some-Vegas-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Age Requirement Lowered to 18 for Some Vegas Casinos"></a>Age Requirement Lowered to 18 for Some Vegas Casinos</h1><p>In order to keep up with the competition, some Vegas casinos are altering their age requirements. The Palms Casino Resort has announced that it will now allow guests as young as 18 years old on its property starting August 1st.</p>
<p>The Venetian and Palazzo resorts have also announced a change in their age policy. Both properties will now allow guests as young as 18 beginning September 1st. These properties were previously only open to those 21 and older.</p>
<p>These new policies come as a result of MGM Resorts International’s recent acquisition of the Golden Nugget casino. That casino already allows people as young as 18 inside its doors. MGM is looking to stay competitive by matching that policy at its other casinos.</p>
<p>MGM’s COO for Las Vegas, Alan Feldman, had this to say about the change:</p>
<p>“We believe this new access point will create more opportunities for visitors to enjoy our properties and underscores our commitment to provide a world-class experience across our resorts.”</p>
<p>Some parents are happy about the change, as they feel it gives their children more freedom when visiting Vegas. Others are worried that the lowered age requirement will lead to more reckless behavior from young adults.</p>
<h1 id="Players-as-Young-as-16-Can-Gamble-at-Some-Las-Vegas-Casinos"><a href="#Players-as-Young-as-16-Can-Gamble-at-Some-Las-Vegas-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Players as Young as 16 Can Gamble at Some Las Vegas Casinos"></a>Players as Young as 16 Can Gamble at Some Las Vegas Casinos</h1><p>According to the Las Vegas Sun, there are some casinos in Sin City that will allow players as young as 16 years old to gamble. The minimum age requirement is 21 years old at most other gambling venues in the city.</p>
<p>The two casinos that make an allowance for younger players are the Silverton Casino Lodge and the South Point Hotel, Casino and Spa. A spokeswoman for the Silverton said that their casino has been catering to families for many years, and they want to make sure that gaming is available for people of all ages.</p>
<p>A manager at the South Point said that their casino has been doing the same thing for about 10 years now. He added that they have not had any major incidents with underage gamblers so far.</p>
<p>With gaming tables and machines spread out across numerous properties, Las Vegas is undoubtedly one of the most popular destinations in the world for gambling enthusiasts of all ages. While it’s great to have a variety of options when it comes to enjoying gaming activities, it’s also important to be aware of the risks associated with underage gambling.</p>
<p>There are a number of dangers associated with gambling at a young age, including developing addictive behaviors and potentially ending up in debt. In addition, research has shown that adolescents who gamble are more likely to engage in other risky behaviors, such as drinking and using drugs.</p>
<p>It’s crucial that parents talk to their children about gambling and explain the risks involved before allowing them to participate in any activities related to betting or gaming. If you are planning on travelling to Las Vegas with your family, be sure to do your research on which casinos allow underage players before making any final decisions.</p>
<h1 id="Casinos-in-Las-Vegas-Begin-Allowing-Younger-Gamblers"><a href="#Casinos-in-Las-Vegas-Begin-Allowing-Younger-Gamblers" class="headerlink" title="Casinos in Las Vegas Begin Allowing Younger Gamblers"></a>Casinos in Las Vegas Begin Allowing Younger Gamblers</h1><p>The casinos in Las Vegas are now beginning to allow younger gamblers onto their premises. While those over the age of 21 have always been able to gamble in Las Vegas, the casinos are now beginning to admit those who are 18 and up. This change has come about as a result of new legislation that was recently passed in the state of Nevada.</p>
<p>This new legislation is part of a larger trend that is seeing casinos around the country relaxing their policies with regards to who is able to gamble. In recent years, there has been a growing movement among those in the industry to make gambling more inclusive, and this new legislation is the latest step in that direction.</p>
<p>The casinos in Las Vegas have long been seen as some of the most restrictive in the country, and this change is likely to help them stay competitive in an increasingly tight market. In addition, by allowing younger gamblers onto their premises, the casinos can foster a more family-friendly environment, which could attract more visitors in the long run.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone is happy with this change. Some people believe that gambling should be restricted to those who are 21 or older, and that younger people are not mature enough to handle it. However, research has shown that most young people who gamble do so responsibly, and that there is no need for such strict age restrictions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it will be up to each casino to decide whether or not they want to admit younger gamblers. However, it seems likely that this trend will continue, as casinos around the country continue to loosen their policies regarding age restrictions.</p>
<h1 id="Some-Las-Vegas-Casinos-Now-Allow-Teenagers-to-Gamble"><a href="#Some-Las-Vegas-Casinos-Now-Allow-Teenagers-to-Gamble" class="headerlink" title="Some Las Vegas Casinos Now Allow Teenagers to Gamble"></a>Some Las Vegas Casinos Now Allow Teenagers to Gamble</h1><p>Las Vegas is a well known tourist destination, and people of all ages visit the city every year. However, until recently one age group was not able to gamble in Las Vegas casinos - teenagers.</p>
<p>That has changed in recent months, as a few Las Vegas casinos have decided to allow teenagers to gamble. The reasoning behind the decision is that the casinos want to appeal to a younger audience, and they believe that allowing teenagers to gamble will do just that.</p>
<p>So far, the reaction from parents and teenagers has been mixed. Some people are happy that teenagers can now enjoy gambling in Las Vegas, while others believe that it is too young an age for kids to be gambling.</p>
<p>No matter where you stand on this issue, it is important to remember that gambling can be addictive and dangerous. So if you are thinking about letting your teenager gamble in Las Vegas, be sure to talk with them about the risks involved first.</p>
<h1 id="Starlight-Kiss-Game-Allows-Players-as-Young-as-18-in-its-Casino-Version"><a href="#Starlight-Kiss-Game-Allows-Players-as-Young-as-18-in-its-Casino-Version" class="headerlink" title="Starlight Kiss Game Allows Players as Young as 18 in its Casino Version"></a>Starlight Kiss Game Allows Players as Young as 18 in its Casino Version</h1><p>The Slot game company “Starlight Kiss” has announced a Casino Version of its popular game which will allow players as young as 18 years old to join in the fun.</p>
<p>The Casino Version of the game will be available to play online at the company website from Wednesday, February 14th. Players can look forward to enjoying all the features of the game, including the bonus round, in a real-world casino environment.</p>
