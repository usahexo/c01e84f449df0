#  Mississippi Hard Rock Casino to Open in 2019

Mississippi will finally get its first hard rock casino in 2019. The $245 million casino is set to open in Biloxi and will create 1,500 jobs.

Gateway Casinos and Entertainment Limited is the company behind the new casino. It already operates 17 casinos in Canada.

The new casino is expected to be a major draw for tourists, who will now have a variety of gaming options in Mississippi, which include legal sports betting and dog racing.

Biloxi was recently hit hard by Hurricane Michael, but the mayor is optimistic that the new casino will help revive the economy.

#  Tunica County Welcomes New Mississippi Hard Rock Casino

Tunica County is excited to announce the newest addition to its thriving casino industry. Mississippi's Hard Rock Casino will be opening in 2019 and bringing 1,500 new jobs to the area. This world-class facility will feature a 100,000 square foot gaming floor, high-end restaurants, a ballroom, and a 400-room hotel.

"We are thrilled to welcome Hard Rock Casino to our community," said Tunica County Economic Development Authority Chairperson Sheila Sharp. "This world-class facility will create hundreds of jobs and bring more tourists to our region. We look forward to working with them as they open their doors next year."

The new casino will join the six other gaming facilities in Tunica County, which employ over 5,000 people and generate over $200 million in annual gaming revenue. It is expected that the Hard Rock Casino will generate an additional $100 million in gaming revenue each year.

"We are very excited about our new property in Tunica County," said Jim Allen, CEO of Hard Rock International. "This world-class casino will offer guests an incredible experience with top-notch entertainment and dining options."

The opening of the Hard Rock Casino is another sign of Tunica County's resurgence since the economic downturn a decade ago. The county has seen renewed interest from businesses and developers, and its unemployment rate is now among the lowest in the state.

"Tunica County is on the rise," said Sharp. "The opening of the Hard Rock Casino is another indication that we are a destination for business and leisure travelers alike. We look forward to continuing to grow our economy and create jobs for years to come."

#  Ground Broken for New Mississippi Hard Rock Casino

In June of this year, ground was broken for a new Hard Rock casino in Biloxi, Mississippi. The $250 million project is expected to be completed by late 2019.

The new casino will be the largest in the state, with 100,000 square feet of gaming space and 2,500 slots and video poker machines. It will also have a 35,000-square-foot music venue and a 6,000-square-foot spa.

The Hard Rock casino has been a huge success in other states, and officials are confident that it will be just as popular in Mississippi. "This is another step in our efforts to make Biloxi the most popular gaming destination on the Gulf Coast," said Mayor Andrew "FoFo" Gilich.

The new casino is expected to create 1,500 jobs, and it will also generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for the state. Governor Phil Bryant praised the project, saying that it will "bring good jobs and much-needed economic development to Biloxi."

There has been some opposition to the new casino from local businesses, but most people seem to be excited about it. "I'm glad they're doing something with that spot," said one resident. "It's been an eyesore for years."

#  First Look at Plans for Mississippi Hard Rock Casino

Gov. Phil Bryant and other officials revealed the initial plans for a new casino development in Tunica County, Mississippi on Thursday. The $d billion casino resort would be built on the site of the former Robinsonville-Tunica Airport and is expected to create 3,000 jobs.

Renderings of the development show a massive complex with a hotel, concert hall, spa, and multiple restaurants. The centerpiece of the complex will be a Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, which will include a guitar-shaped lazy river.

"This project has the potential to create thousands of jobs for Mississippians and generate millions in revenue for our state," Gov. Bryant said at the announcement event. "I'm proud to support it and look forward to seeing it come to fruition."

The developers, who are yet to be announced, say they expect construction to begin in early 2019 and be complete by 2021. They are seeking tax breaks from the state as part of the deal.

Casino gaming has been legal in Mississippi since 1990, when voters approved a constitutional amendment authorizing up to 15 casinos in the state. There are currently nine operating casinos in Mississippi, most of which are located in the Tunica County region.

#  Mississippi Gambling Commission Approves New Hard Rock Casino

On Tuesday, the Mississippi Gambling Commission voted unanimously to approve a new casino license for the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Biloxi. The new casino will be located on the site of the old Imperial Palace, which was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

The approval is a major victory for the developers of the new casino, who have been working since 2009 to get it approved. The project has faced opposition from some local residents, who are concerned about its potential impact on the community.

The new casino will include a hotel, concert venue, and restaurant complex. It is expected to create 1,500 jobs and generate more than $200 million in annual revenue for the state of Mississippi.
