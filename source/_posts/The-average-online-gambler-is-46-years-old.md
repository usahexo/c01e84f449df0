#  The average online gambler is 46 years old

A recent study by The Innovation Group has found that the average online gambler is 46-years-old. Furthermore, 77% of all online gamblers are male.

The study also looked at the different types of gambling that are popular online. The top three were casino games (78%), sports betting (72%), and poker (54%).

Interestingly, there was a large difference in the percentages of men and women who gamble on each type of game. For example, 95% of men gamble on casino games, while only 58% of women do the same. Meanwhile, 67% of women gamble on bingo, compared to just 18% of men.

One possible explanation for these gender differences is that traditional gambling options such as casinos and lottery tickets are seen as more 'masculine'. Online bingo, on the other hand, is often seen as a more social activity that is enjoyed by women.

The report also found that the most popular day for online gambling is Friday, while the least popular day is Monday. This may be because people want to relax at the end of the week or because they are using their weekend to make bets.

Whatever the reason, it is clear that online gambling is becoming increasingly popular with people of all ages. So if you're looking for a new way to have some fun, why not try out an online casino?

#  Most online casino gamblers are over 55

The average age of an online casino gambler is 55, according to a study by the University of Tasmania. This is in line with the average age of all online casino players, which is 54.

The study also found that men are more likely to gamble online than women, and that those who do gamble online are more likely to be regular gamblers. Around two-thirds of online casino gamblers said they gambled at least once a week, compared to just one-third of those who don't gamble online.

It's not clear why older people are more likely to gamble online than younger people, but it could be because they're more comfortable with computers and technology, or because they have more money available to them.

Whatever the reason, the findings suggest that casinos should focus on targeting older players if they want to attract more customers. This could involve developing better websites and apps that are easy to use, as well as offering bonuses and promotions that appeal to older people.

It's also worth noting that the study didn't look at whether or not online gambling is harmful, so it's possible that some of these casino gamblers may be addicted to gambling. This is something that needs further research.

#  Wagering on the internet is most popular with those 65 and over

While other age brackets are certainly spending money gambling on the internet, those aged 65 and up account for the lion’s share of this activity. In fact, this group is responsible for more than half of online wagers made in the United States.

There could be any number of reasons why seniors are so keen on gambling online. Maybe they feel like they have more time on their hands and less to worry about. It could also be that they’re more comfortable with technology and feel like they have a better chance of winning with games that can be played from the comfort of their home.

Whatever the reason, it’s clear that seniors are driving this trend and casinos are taking notice. They’re increasingly catering to this demographic with bonuses, promotions, and special offers that are tailored specifically for those over 65. So if you’re looking to gamble online, it might be worth considering doing so when you reach retirement age!

#  Seniors account for more than half of all online gambling transactions

On any given day, there are millions of people around the world gambling online. Regardless of the country you reside in, the odds are good that you can find a reputable and legal online casino to gamble at. And while there’s no shortage of players at any given site, there are some demographics who account for a greater share of gaming activity than others.

Seniors, for example, represent more than half of all online gambling transactions. This is likely due in part to the fact that seniors have more disposable income and more free time than other age groups. In addition, many seniors enjoy gaming as a form of entertainment, and online casinos offer an array of games that can appeal to this audience.

Other age groups also enjoy gambling online, but seniors account for the majority of transactions by a wide margin. This suggests that seniors are an especially important target demographic for the online casino industry.

#  The older you are, the more likely you are to gamble on the internet

Gambling is a popular pastime all over the world, with people of all ages enjoying a flutter on games such as blackjack, roulette or poker. However, there is evidence to suggest that those who gamble in their older years are more likely to do so on the internet than those who are younger.

A study by the University of British Columbia found that nearly two-thirds of seniors who gambled in the previous year had gambled online. This was in comparison to just over one-third of those aged 18 to 34 who had gambled online in the same period. The research also showed that seniors were more likely to engage in other forms of gambling, such as at casinos or through lotteries.

There are a number of reasons why older people may be more inclined to gamble on the internet. One possibility is that they feel they have more control over their decisions when they are gambling online than they do when they are gambling in person. They may also feel that it is a more anonymous way to gamble, which can make them feel less inhibited. As we get older, we may also become more comfortable with technology and prefer to gamble online rather than going out to a casino.

While there is no definitive answer as to why seniors are more likely to gamble on the internet, it is clear that this trend is increasing. In order to protect yourself from becoming embroiled in this type of gambling, it is important to be aware of the risks and know how to stay safe. Here are some tips:

- Only gamble with money that you can afford to lose - never borrow money or use credit cards to finance your gambling activities.

- Make sure you know what the stakes are and how much you could potentially lose if you were to bet on a particular game.

- Stick to reputable websites and casinos - there are many fake sites out there, so be careful before signing up for any gambling activity.

- Avoid spending too much time gambling - it can be easy to get caught up in the excitement of online betting, but don't let it consume your life. Set limits for yourself and stick to them.

- Seek help if you feel you are struggling with your gambling habit - there is plenty of support available for those who need it. Gambling addiction can be very damaging both mentally and financially, so don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it.
