The Potawatomi Casino Milwaukee Samoa offers 1,929 gaming devices, adjustable game seats and a few restaurants. The casino is huge! Located on the main floor is 130 gaming tables which occupy over 21,000 sq ft., almost two thirds of the gambling area. In addition to the table games, there are also 1,799 slot machines and video poker terminals. Upstairs you will find Keno and more slot machines. The casino is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Surprisingly there is no smoking inside which might be a good or bad thing, depending on your preference.

The Seminole tribe owns the casino and it is managed by the Molasky Group of Companies out of Las Vegas. The tribe has done an excellent job in building this world-class facility that rivals anything you would find on the Vegas strip.

The layout of the casino is very easy to follow with plenty of well-marked signage. The slots are located in one area and the table games in another. There are plenty of cocktail waitresses walking around so you never have to go too long without a drink. They offer a wide variety of drinks including beer, wine, cocktails and non-alcoholic drinks.

One downside is that they do not offer complimentary drinks while you are gambling which is standard at most casinos. However, they do have a good rewards program that gives you points for every dollar you spend which can be redeemed for free play, food and merchandise discounts, and hotel stays.

As far as seating goes, there are plenty of adjustable game seats throughout the casino which makes it comfortable for all sizes. You will also find several high-top tables if you want to stand while playing your favorite game. There are no shortage of places to sit down and enjoy some food either with several full-service restaurants as well as a food court with several fast food options.

Overall, I was very impressed with the Potawatomi Casino Milwaukee Samoa. It is definitely one of the nicer casinos I have been to and offers something for everyone. If you are ever in Milwaukee I highly recommend checking it out!
