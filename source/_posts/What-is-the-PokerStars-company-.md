#  Who is the Bill Gates person? 

If you have ever used a computer, chances are you have used software developed by Microsoft. The company was founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen and has become a household name. However, most people don’t know much about the man behind the empire.

Bill Gates was born on October 28, 1955 in Seattle, Washington. From an early age, he showed an interest in math and science. When he was just 17 years old, he started his own company, Traf-O-Data, which tracked traffic data using custom-made computers.

In 1974, Gates teamed up with Paul Allen to form Microsoft. The two young entrepreneurs originally focused on developing software for the Altair 8800, one of the first personal computers. Gates’s knack for business and Allen’s technical expertise soon turned Microsoft into a leading software maker.

Microsoft’s flagship product was MS-DOS, which was licensed to IBM in 1981. The company then went on to release several other groundbreaking products, including Windows, Office and Internet Explorer.

Today, Bill Gates is no longer involved in day-to-day operations at Microsoft but remains on the board of directors. He is also a major philanthropist and has committed billions of dollars to charitable causes through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Despite his vast fortune and iconic status, Gates is known for being down-to-earth and approachable. He is often quoted as saying “It’s not about money. It’s about changing the world”. And that is exactly what he has done throughout his career – helping to make computing accessible to everyone and improving the quality of life for millions of people around the globe.
