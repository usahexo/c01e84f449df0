#  Bill Gates Launches Online Casino in Australia

Bill Gates is no stranger to bold business ventures. The Microsoft co-founder has invested in or started dozens of businesses throughout his career, including the world’s largest public relations firm, a Canadian National Railway, and a Chinese advertising company.

Now he’s decided to get into the online casino industry with a new venture in Australia. Gates’ new casino, called OzCasino, will offer slot machines, poker, and other casino games to Australian players.

Gates is no novice when it comes to gambling; he has been known to place bets on college basketball games. But OzCasino will be one of the first online casinos available to Australians. It will compete against established brands such as Crown Casino and Star Entertainment Group.

The online casino market is growing rapidly in Australia; in 2017, it was worth more than $1.5 billion. And with Gates’ backing, OzCasino is sure to be a major player in the market.

#  Bill Gates To Start Online Casino In Australia 

Microsoft co-founder and billionaire, Bill Gates is set to start an online casino in Australia. The new venture will be a joint-venture with Crown Resorts, and the two are planning to spend $500 million on the project.

The move is seen as a way for Crown Resorts to offset the impact of a crackdown on gambling by the Chinese government. The company has been dealing with falling profits from its operations in Macau, which is currently the world’s largest gambling market.

Crown Resorts will hold a majority stake in the new casino, with Bill Gates holding a minority stake. The two companies have not yet announced which games will be offered on the site.

It is not yet clear whether or not the new online casino will be available to players in China. Chinese authorities have been cracking down on gambling activities in recent years, and last year they ordered Crown Resorts to close its resorts in Macau.

The crackdown has been causing problems for Crown Resorts, which has seen its profits plunge in recent years. The company is hoping that the new online casino will help boost its profits.

Bill Gates is no stranger to the casino industry, having previously invested in Las Vegas’s Aliante Casino & Hotel. He also has ties to the online gambling industry, having previously invested in Canadian gaming company Stars Group Inc.

#  Gates plans new online casino in Australia 

Microsoft founder Bill Gates is planning to launch a new online casino in Australia. The move comes as the billionaire looks to expand his business interests in the region.

Gates' new online casino will be based out of Melbourne, and is expected to go live in 2019. It will offer a range of popular casino games, including slots, blackjack, and roulette.

The launch of Gates' new online casino is sure to create a stir in the Australian gambling market. The country's two largest players, Crown Resorts and Tatts Group, are both expected to face stiff competition from the Microsoft mogul.

In a statement, Gates said that he was excited about launching his new gambling venture in Australia. "We believe there is a great opportunity to offer a superior product and service to Australian players," he said.

It's not clear yet whether Gates' new online casino will target the local market or international players. But given his track record, it's likely that the site will be aimed at global audiences.

Whatever the case may be, Gates' entry into the Australian gambling market is sure to be met with stiff competition. With so much at stake, it will be interesting to see how things play out over the next few years.

#  Gates backs new online casino in Australia 
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has announced he is backing a new online casino in Australia. 
Gates is teaming up with casino mogul James Packer to launch the new venture, which is expected to go live in 2018.

The casino will be based in Sydney and will offer a range of online gaming options, including poker, blackjack and slots. It is hoped the venture will create 1,000 jobs in the area.

Packer said he was excited about the new project, commenting "This will be our first foray into the online gambling space and we are looking forward to working with Bill on this venture."

Gates added that he was "thrilled" to be partnering with Packer on the new venture. "James is a world-class operator and I know he will build a successful casino," he said.

The news comes as the Australian government considers relaxing its gambling laws. In October 2017, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he was open to relaxing restrictions on gambling in order to help revive the country's struggling economy.

#  Microsoft founder Bill Gates to launch online casino in Australia

Austalia's online gambling market is set to heat up with the launch of Microsoft founder Bill Gates' new online casino, 'Windows Casino'. Scheduled to go live in early 2019, the new venture is expected to compete with the likes of Australian-owned Crown Resorts and global player PokerStars.

Gates announced the launch of his new venture on social media, where he also revealed that he would be taking a hands-on role in the day-to-day operations of the business. "I'm really excited about this new venture," Gates said. "Windows Casino is going to offer a world-class experience for Australian players, and I'm looking forward to being involved in it from day one."

According to analysts, the move into the Australian online gambling market by Gates represents a significant challenge to incumbent operators such as Crown Resorts. "There's no doubt that Gates is a serious player in online casino," said one industry analyst. "He has the resources and track record to make a big impact in Australia."

The entry of Gates into the Australian online gambling market is likely to result in increased competition for players, with lower margins for operators. This is already being seen in the shape of some aggressive marketing campaign by Windows Casino in the weeks leading up to its launch.
