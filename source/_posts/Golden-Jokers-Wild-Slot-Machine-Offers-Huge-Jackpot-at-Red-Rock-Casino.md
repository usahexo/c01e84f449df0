#  Golden Jokers Wild a Popular Game at Red Rock Casino

The Golden Jokers Wild game at the Red Rock Casino Resort Spa is a popular one. This game is a variation of five card stud poker and is played with a deck of 53 cards. There are two jokers in the deck which are wild and can be used as any other card in the deck to make a winning hand.

The Golden Jokers Wild game begins by each player being dealt five cards, face down. The player then decides if they want to keep all five cards or exchange any or all of them for new cards from the dealer. After the players have made their decision, the dealer deals each player four more cards, face up. These four cards are community cards that can be used by all players to make their best hand. The dealer then turns over one more card, which is also community, and sets this in the middle of the table.

The player who has the best five-card poker hand using any of their seven cards (five original and two community) wins the pot. If there is a tie, the pot is split between the players involved in the tie.
