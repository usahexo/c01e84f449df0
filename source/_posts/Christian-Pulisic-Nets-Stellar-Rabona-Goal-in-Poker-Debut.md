#  Christian Pulisic Nets Stellar Rabona Goal in Poker Debut

Sunday night’s clash between Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen was always primed to be an entertaining one, and Christian Pulisic made sure to add some extra fireworks in his first-ever poker match.

The American youngster started on the bench for the Bundesliga clash but was called upon in the 56th minute with his team down by two goals. And just minutes after coming on, Pulisic managed to score a stunning rabona goal to pull one back for Dortmund.

While the goal didn’t prove to be enough to salvage a point for his side, it was still an impressive debut for the 19-year-old in poker. The rabona is widely considered to be one of the most difficult shots in soccer, so scoring one in your very first match is definitely no easy feat.
